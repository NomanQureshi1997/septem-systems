## Question: Describe the concept of data binding in Vue.js and its advantages.

It's simple, The magic happening in this app is all due to data binding, I am able to save input field value without making any action. If we go towards the defination it is as follow:

```
Data binding in Vue. js establishes a connection between the application's data and the DOM. It allows you to reflect changes in the data directly in the user interface and vice versa.
```

### Advantages:

1. Efficient Updates
2. Reusable Components
3. Reduces user actions & page refresh.
4. Increased Productivity (No need to define functions to saves values)
5. Declarative Syntax etc
